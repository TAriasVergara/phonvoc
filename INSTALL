Phonvoc depends upon:
- Idiap Speech Signal Processing
https://github.com/idiap/ssp
- and Kaldi project
https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi

Please install both repositories, and set your local paths at the
beginning of the Config.sh (lines 12 and 13).

Phonvoc is a collection of bash and zsh scripts with pre-trained
models, no further installation is needed.
